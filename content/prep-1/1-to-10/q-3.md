### Description

Write a program to check if a given year is a leap year.

### Example

Input: `year = 2020`
Output: `Leap Year`
Explanation: 2020 is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is divisible by 400, so it is a leap year.

### Solution:

```javascript
const isLeapYear = (year) => ((year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || year % 400 === 0 ? "Leap Year" : "Not a Leap Year");
console.log(isLeapYear(2020)); // Output: Leap Year
```
