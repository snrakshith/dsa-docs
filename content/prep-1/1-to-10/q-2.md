**Description**: Write a program to determine if a number is prime.

### Example:

Input: `number = 7`
Output: `Prime`
Explanation: 7 has no divisors other than 1 and itself, so it is a prime number.

### Solution

```javascript
const isPrime = (number) => {
  if (number <= 1) return "Not Prime";
  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(number); i++) {
    if (number % i === 0) return "Not Prime";
  }
  return "Prime";
};
console.log(isPrime(7)); // Output: Prime
```
