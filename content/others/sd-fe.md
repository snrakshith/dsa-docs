description: ""
---

A curation of code examples and in depth technical implementation approaches to solve the common frontend system design issues in React.

---

### Target Audience

1. advanced beginner/intermediate developers wishing to get better technical understanding
2. developers exploring how to do handle technical things in their own projects.
3. for my own reference as I need something like this for my own learning.

---

### Philosophy

The philosophy behind this endeavour is to document as much as possible a practical guide for someone looking to level-up fast/ implement things.

> “Talk is cheap. Show me the code.”
> — Linus Torvalds

### High Level Design details

<br>

**Product Requirement Document (PRD) / Design Document**

- Identify Scope/Requirement
- Review your understanding with stakeholders

<br>

**Discuss about Design/Wireframe**

- Think like an architect.
- We should not consider team bandwidth, capacity and time.
- Discuss about Edge cases.
- Robustness: Handle SPOF (Single Point of Failure) ex: Monitoring, Logging

<br>

**Identify Business**

- Is it B2B (business-to-business)?
- Is it B2C (business-to-consumer)?
- Is it Internal Product?
- Is it Customer facing product?

<br>

**Identify Platform**

- Desktop
- Mobile
- Tablet

<br>

**Identify Users (Know your audience)**

- Conduct surveys
- Discuss about Location and Devices
- Internet speed
- End Users knowledge base (ex: Technical user)
- Pilot Product (sometimes to understand audience)

<br>

**Identify Design Approach**

- Responsive vs Adaptive design
- Desktop first vs Mobile first

<br>

**Identify APIs**

- Rest APIs / Graph APIs / RPC
- JSON / Protocol buffers

<br>

**Role based management**

- Large system needs roles based access and permissions
- Authentication and Authorization
- Read/Write/View Permissions
- Discuss about Routes/Component access

<br>

**Identify Right Platform (compare frameworks based on the use case)**

- Single Page Applications (Unsuitable for Blogs/News based products)
  - No reloading of a page at navigation
  - No SEO
- Multi Page Applications
  - Reloading of a page at every page navigation.
- Progressive Web Applications
  - Provides offline support and native like functionality.
  - [Examples of PWA](https://github.com/hemanth/awesome-pwa)
- Server Side Rendering
  - [SSR](https://survivejs.com/webpack/output/server-side-rendering/)
  * Better SEO
- Important points to discuss:
  - Are users on mobile?
  - Is SEO needed?
  - Is SPA enough?
  - Is PWA enough? (Service worker, Web Worker)
  - Compare SSR / SSG / CSR
  - Any Pricing model? (optional) - Subscriptions based, Paid APIs
  - Will my app be Frontend heavy? (or backend heavy)
  - Do I have resources for this skill?
  - Is your application Canvas (or SVG) heavy? (Figma, Draw.io) - [example](https://github.com/rrag/react-stockcharts-examples2)
  - Is your application webRTC heavy? (Video streaming) - [example](https://github.com/OpenVidu/openvidu-call-react)

<br>

**Identify User Flow**

- Discuss vision of a product.
- Do we need to build from scratch or we can leverage some existing functionalities
- Discuss about authentication and authorization (Google auth / OAuth)
- Interact with the Product manager to understand the scope before designing the application.
- Discuss happy scenarios.
- Discuss edge cases.
- Discuss failing scenarios

<br>

**Identify MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**

- Problem -> Solution -> Build MVP -> MVP to Customers
- Discuss MVP phase with product manager
- Discuss roadmaps and divide product in milestones
- After MVP release there can be a slight change in design/approach to make the product better

<br>

**Volume of Operations**

- Discuss about the end users of the product
  - Observe the data in something like Google Analytics for split by device/location/OS etc in production later.
- Identify QPS (Queries per second)
  - Monitor throughput of the web server/ web application server - [benchmark for reference](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r20&hw=ph&test=fortune)
- Discuss about Load testing/Stress testing
  - Use something like [Locust](https://locust.io/)/[boomer](https://github.com/myzhan/boomer)
- Inject analytics in application (ex: Google analytics, Sentry, NewRelic)
  - For cost-effectiveness instead of using ready-made solution, can define our events, using Kafka to stream the events to a backend server and use a Grafana dashboard if required.
- Analytics data helps us to scale the system

<br>

**[SEO (Search Engine Optimization)](https://github.com/marcobiedermann/search-engine-optimization)**

- Crawling
- Use of Heading tags
- Semantic tags - [HTML Reference](https://htmlreference.io/) - [Example](https://github.com/joelhooks/joelhooks-com/blob/main/src/components/SEO.js)

- Organic approach vs Inorganic approach
- Use of alt tags
- 301 Redirects (bad for SEO)
- Robots.txt - [Example](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/tietracker/blob/main/public/robots.txt)
- [Open graph protocol](https://ogp.me/) for social graph - [Example](https://github.com/gabroun/malikgabroun/blob/master/src/components/Seo.js)

  - Code level - Git
  - Artifacts level - Artifactory
  - Asset level - Git/ Blob storage(S3 etc)/CDN
- Git Hooks (pre commit hooks, husky)
- - Example - [code](https://gitlab.com/kachkaev/website/-/blob/master/package.json)

<br>

**Governance**

- Controlling the workflows and protecting the assets
- UX Design -> Developers -> Product Managers -> UX Designing -> QA
- Code level governance - like PRs approval (sets standard in your team)
  - [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
- Artifacts/Assets level governance (before go live)
- like Product Manager approval, Stakeholders approvals

<br>

**Experiment based release cycle**

- Experiment flag, which can help in the release cycle

  Example : In a recent codebase I worked, we had a flag in the frontend codebase that was enabled/disabled based on the response received from API(in turn , API routes in node.js server were handled in 2 ways : 1) the server code read the values based on the server configuration(ENV values) for that particular deployment 2)actual backend that had its configuration as well) affecting the user experience and user journey.

<br>

**NFR (Non Functional Requirement)**

- Discuss about CI/CD (Docker, Pipeline)
  - Alexander Kachkaev's personal website has a good pipeline setup - see [code](https://gitlab.com/kachkaev/website)
