### 1. **FormBuilder**

- **Description**: This is the top-level component responsible for managing the overall form structure. It serves as a container for all other components.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Maintains the state of the entire form (e.g., values, validation status).
  - Handles form submission and validation logic.
  - Can provide a context for child components to access common data and methods (e.g., using React Context or state management libraries like Redux).

### 2. **MultiSection**

- **Description**: This component represents a collection of sections within the form. It allows users to add or remove sections dynamically.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Renders multiple `Section` components based on the current form structure.
  - Provides the ability to manage the order of sections (e.g., drag-and-drop functionality).
  - Might include controls for adding new sections, such as buttons for “Add Section”.

### 3. **Section**

- **Description**: A `Section` component groups related questions. It provides a logical division within the form, making it easier for users to navigate and complete.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Renders multiple `MultiQuestion` components.
  - Can include a title or header for the section, along with description text if needed.
  - Handles local state and functionality specific to the section (e.g., validation for questions in that section).
  - Provides functionality to delete the section or reorder it.

### 4. **MultiQuestion**

- **Description**: This component represents a collection of questions within a section. It allows for the dynamic addition and removal of questions.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Renders multiple `Question` components.
  - Manages the order of questions and provides controls for adding or removing questions.
  - Might handle validation logic for the questions contained within it.

### 5. **Question**

- **Description**: The `Question` component represents an individual question within the form. It is the lowest level in the hierarchy and is responsible for rendering the question interface (e.g., text input, dropdown, etc.).
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Renders the question text and associated input fields (e.g., `Field`, `TextField`, etc.).
  - Handles local state management for the question, including user input and validation errors.
  - Can provide features such as conditional rendering based on user input or validation criteria.
  - Includes controls for editing, deleting, or configuring question-specific options.

### **Benefits of This Hierarchy**

- **Modularity**: Each component has a specific responsibility, making the codebase easier to manage and reason about.
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts (e.g., you can use the `MultiQuestion` component in other forms if needed).
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component handles its own state and logic, reducing complexity in the top-level `FormBuilder`.
- **Dynamic Capabilities**: The hierarchical structure allows for easy addition and removal of sections and questions, facilitating dynamic form-building experiences.
